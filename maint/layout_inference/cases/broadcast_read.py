"""Broadcast read of a tiny fragment inside a wide parallel loop (#1729).

``s_frag`` has fewer elements than there are threads, and every thread
reads it while streaming ``Out``.  This is THE case the two cost models
disagree on, and the disagreement is the point:

  - register-count picks a 1-slot partially-replicated ``s_frag`` (fewer
    registers) whose induced loop layout collapses the j axis onto each
    thread — every thread serially walks all of j, with the whole loop
    redundantly replicated across threads.  That is the issue #1729
    pathology, preserved in the golden as the documented legacy baseline.
  - io-aware must reject it via the issue term: ``s_frag`` fully
    replicated (replicate == thread count) and a non-replicated,
    coalesced loop layout over ``Out``.  Enforced by ``check`` below.
