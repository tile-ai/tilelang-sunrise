"""Global -> fragment -> global roundtrip: the baseline sanity case.

Both directions of the roundtrip want the same thing — the fragment's
last logical axis split into (vector run per thread, coalesced lanes) —
so both cost models must land on the same coalesced, vectorized layout.
This case anchors the invariant that turning the io-aware model ON does
not perturb layouts the register-count model already gets right, and it
is the primary equal-score anchor for any future fast-path/slow-path
split inside the cost model.
