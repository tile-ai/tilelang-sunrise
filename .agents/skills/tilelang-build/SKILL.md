# Build & Install

## Installing / Rebuilding tilelang

TileLang-Sunrise includes TVM and tvm-ffi source directly. Build and install
tvm-ffi before installing TileLang:

```bash
SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION=0.1.11+sunrise.1 \
  python -m pip install ./3rdparty/tvm_sunrise/3rdparty/tvm-ffi
pip install .
```

Or with verbose output for debugging build issues:

```bash
pip install . -v
```

`uv pip install .` also works if `uv` is available but is not required.

Build dependencies are declared in `pyproject.toml` and resolved automatically during `pip install .`.

If `ccache` is available, repeated builds only recompile changed C++ files.

## Alternative: Development Build with `--no-build-isolation`

If you need faster iteration (e.g. calling `cmake` directly to recompile C++ without re-running the full pip install), install build dependencies first:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install --no-build-isolation .
```

After this, you can invoke `cmake --build build` directly to recompile only changed C++ files. This is useful when iterating on C++ code.

## Alternative: cmake + PYTHONPATH (recommended for C++ development)

For the fastest C++ iteration, bypass pip entirely and drive cmake directly:

```bash
# Configure from the self-contained source tree
cmake -S . -B build

# Build
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)

# Make the local tilelang package importable
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd):$PYTHONPATH
```

After the initial configure, recompiling is just `cmake --build build -j$(nproc)`. The runtime automatically discovers native libraries from `build/lib/` when it detects a dev checkout (see `tilelang/env.py`).

Useful cmake options:

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `-DUSE_CUDA=ON/OFF` | Enable/disable CUDA backend (ON by default) |
| `-DUSE_ROCM=ON` | Enable ROCm/HIP backend |
| `-DUSE_METAL=ON` | Enable Metal backend (default on macOS) |
| `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` | Debug build with `TVM_LOG_DEBUG` enabled |

## Editable Installs

`pip install -e .` is a supported development install, and is what `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `docs/get_started/Installation.md` recommend for development:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -e . -v --no-build-isolation
```

Notes specific to this repo's layout:

- When Python is run from the repo root, the local `./tilelang` directory is imported instead of any copy installed into `site-packages` (because the repo root is on `sys.path` ahead of `site-packages`). This is by design: `tilelang/env.py` detects a dev checkout (when `3rdparty/` is not inside the package dir) and loads native libraries from `build/lib/` and `build/tvm/`, logging `Loading tilelang libs from dev root: <repo>/build`.
- Because of the above, both approaches resolve imports to the local `./tilelang` when run from the repo root. Use `pip install -e .` when you want pip to manage package metadata/dependencies; use `PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)` only for the lighter-weight import-only workflow.
- For pure C++ iteration (no Python metadata needed), the `cmake + PYTHONPATH` flow above is faster and avoids re-running pip entirely.

## TANG/PTPU extension

For a TANG build, enable `USE_TANG=ON` (or `USE_TANG=1`) and verify that
`tvm.get_global_func("target.build.tilelang_tang", allow_missing=True)` is registered before
debugging higher layers. Read `references/tang-environment.md` for the current repository CI entry
points, single-device preflight, cache isolation, and the source/build/import/runtime fingerprint to
record with a TANG result.

## Running Tests

Most tests require a GPU.

```bash
python -m pytest testing/python/ -x
```

Run a specific test file or test case:

```bash
python -m pytest testing/python/language/test_tilelang_language_copy.py -x
python -m pytest testing/python/language/test_tilelang_language_copy.py -x -k "test_name"
```

For Metal-specific tests (requires macOS with Apple Silicon):

```bash
python -m pytest testing/python/metal/ -x
```
