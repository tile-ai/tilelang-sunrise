"""In-kernel timeline trace tool: annotate, build, run, and export a timeline.

The whole surface is the ``trace`` namespace (see ``tileops.trace.api``
for the full, example-driven reference). In short: ``trace.enable()`` turns
tracing on, ``with trace.range(...)`` / ``trace.group(...)`` mark up a kernel
body, ``trace.out_idx`` + ``trace.finalize`` wire it into a vanilla
``@tilelang.jit`` builder, and ``trace.run`` executes the kernel and dumps the
timeline. With tracing off, markers are stripped and the generated CUDA is
identical to an un-instrumented build.

Lane names are interned dynamically at build time (default ``"main"``); at most
16 distinct lanes fit the packed 4-bit lane field.

Importing this package does **not** touch ``tilelang``: there is no monkeypatch,
and ``tilelang.compile`` / ``tilelang.jit.compile`` stay the originals.
