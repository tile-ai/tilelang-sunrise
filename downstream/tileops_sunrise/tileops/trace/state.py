"""Build-global trace state shared between the annotation API and the transform.

The trace tool splits responsibilities:

* The module-level ``tileops.trace.api.trace`` namespace emits lightweight
  *placeholders* (``tl_trace_marker`` ``call_extern`` nodes) into the kernel body
  and interns the human-readable names referenced by those placeholders into id
  tables.
* The ``tileops.trace.passes.lower`` transform reads those same intern tables
  back out (to build the host-side decode maps) after the kernel is built.

The two halves never call each other directly; they communicate through the
build registry installed here. The ``trace.*`` markers populate a fresh
``TraceState`` per build epoch (``build_state``); ``trace.lower`` reads
it, then retires the epoch (``begin_build_epoch``) so the next build starts
clean.

This is process-global, single-threaded build state: TileLang kernels are built
eagerly on the calling thread, so one build epoch brackets exactly one build.
