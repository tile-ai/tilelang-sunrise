"""Tile-config selection shared by the row-wise norm kernels.

These kernels hold a ``(block_m, N_padded)`` row block in register fragments and
reduce along the row. When ``N_padded`` is not a power of two, TileLang's layout
inference places a partitioned layout for some ``block_m`` but falls back to a
replicated one for others -- each thread owns a whole row, spills to local
memory, and the cross-thread ``AllReduce`` degenerates into a serial loop. That
path is substantially slower yet numerically correct, so correctness tests do
not expose the configuration problem.

``select_row_config`` pins ``block_m=1``: with one row per CTA the per-row
uniformity the reduction needs always holds, so the collapse is impossible for
any N/threads/dtype -- structural, not a tuned value. ``threads`` is raised with
the row size so each thread owns at most ``_MAX_ELEMS_PER_THREAD`` elements (see
the cap comment below); small rows use ``threads=128`` as the default.
``select_row_configs`` keeps ``block_m`` as a swept autotune knob so the kernel
interface is not narrowed; configs that collapse are rejected by autotuning.
