"""Cumulative scan kernels (cumsum, cumprod) using TileLang.

Implements an inclusive prefix scan along the last dimension.  Each row
is processed independently (``T.Parallel`` over rows) with a tiled
sequential inner loop that processes the N dimension in chunks of
``block_n`` elements.  Within each tile, a ``T.Serial`` loop maintains
a per-row running accumulator.  The tiled approach reduces shared memory
usage (``block_m * block_n`` instead of ``block_m * N_padded``) and
improves memory access patterns for better GPU utilization.

Accepts raw ``(M, N)`` input tensors.  Boundary handling for non-aligned
N is performed inside the kernel via masked loads with identity-element
fills (0 for cumsum, 1 for cumprod), eliminating host-side ``F.pad``
from the forward path.  Output is ``(M, N_padded)`` and the Op layer
trims back to N columns.

256-element alignment (512 bytes for fp16/bf16) required by T.copy() shared
memory instructions.

Shared memory padding:
  ``shared_in`` and ``shared_out`` are allocated with ``SMEM_PAD`` extra
  columns so that adjacent rows land on different shared-memory banks,
  eliminating the 32-way bank conflict observed with unpadded layouts.
  For fp16/bf16 (2 bytes/element) the row stride in 4-byte bank words is
  ``(block_n + SMEM_PAD) / 2``.  Choosing SMEM_PAD=8 makes the stride
  68 words, which is not a multiple of 32, so each successive row starts
  in a different bank set.  Element-wise indexing (``smem[i, j]``) is
  used for all smem<->fragment transfers and all global<->smem transfers
  to avoid shape and alignment mismatches with ``T.copy``.

    Accepts an ``(M, N)`` input tensor.  When ``N`` is not a multiple of
    ``block_n`` (which must divide ``N_padded``), the last tile uses
    element-wise ``T.if_then_else`` loads that substitute the identity
    element (0 for sum, 1 for prod) for out-of-bounds columns.  Preceding
    tiles use the fast vectorized ``T.copy`` path since their columns are
    fully in-bounds.

    Uses a tiled approach: the N dimension is divided into tiles of
    ``block_n`` elements. Each tile is loaded via shared memory, scanned
    sequentially with the running accumulator, and written back.

# CumulativeKernel class


class CumulativeKernel(Kernel):
    """Inclusive prefix scan kernel (cumsum / cumprod).

    Supports SM80+ architectures. Uses 256-element alignment for shared
    memory copies. Uses a tiled sequential scan loop along the last
    dimension: the N dimension is divided into tiles of ``block_n``
    elements, reducing shared memory usage and improving occupancy.

    Boundary handling for non-aligned N is performed inside the kernel via
    masked loads with identity-element fills (0 for sum, 1 for prod), so
    no host-side ``F.pad`` is needed.  The ``forward()`` method accepts
