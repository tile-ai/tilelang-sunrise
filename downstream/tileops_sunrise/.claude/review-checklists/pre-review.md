Common rules for every checklist in this folder. Load before any title-specific checklist.

## Review lens

Apply trust-model rules as a review lens: surface cross-layer diffs as comments with a concrete citation; the author replies with rationale; the reviewer judges on content. Provenance labels (`automated` / `needs-review` / `nightshift`) record origin; review criteria apply uniformly.

## Cross-layer review criteria

| Criterion         | Pass                                                                                                                                                                    | Fail                                                                |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Oracle origin     | `ref_program` resolves to PyTorch / NumPy / closed-form / IEEE-754                                                                                                      | Agent-fabricated literal as expected value                          |
| Coverage set      | Unchanged or strictly expanded; deletions target code paths the same diff removes                                                                                       | dtype / shape / sign cells removed with the code path still present |
| New-path coverage | A test reaches each diff-added code path on an input that makes its output differ from the alternative. Aliases (paths with no output-distinguishing input) are exempt. | A diff-added path's output-distinguishing input has no test         |

Cite the failing criterion by name.

## Comment quality

| Rule             | Required form                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Concrete pointer | `file:line`, entry path, field name, parametrize axis, ref URL, test name, or the offending diff line                                                |
| Decidable claim  | A concrete claim about that pointer. Hedged forms ("looks reasonable", "may want to verify", "consider revising", "could be clearer") fail this rule |
| Suggestion scope | Suggestions stay within fixes for flagged items                                                                                                      |

## Scope

Checklists are the floor. Add PR-specific checks when the diff warrants them.
