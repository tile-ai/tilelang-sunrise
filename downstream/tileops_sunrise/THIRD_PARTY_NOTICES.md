## Qwen FlashQLA

Files under `tileops/kernels/gated_deltanet/gdn_prefill/` implement a TileOps
version of the CP-split Gated DeltaNet prefill schedule. The schedule-level
reference for the h-state / corrected-segment-start part of this implementation
comes from Qwen FlashQLA:

- `__init__.py`
- `cp_fwd.py`
- `fused_fwd.py`
- `prepare_h.py`
- `tilelang_compat.py`
- `utils.py`

The TileOps versions are not direct wrappers around the FlashQLA kernels. They
adapt the CP-split scheduling idea into the TileOps operator API, BTHD dispatch,
TileLang compatibility layer, benchmarking, tests, and local replay/output
implementation. The utility file keeps the upstream copyright notice present in
the FlashQLA utility source.
